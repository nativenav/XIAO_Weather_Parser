## Lymington Weather Data Source Investigation - WeatherFile.com

### Overview

**Location**: Lymington, Hampshire (GBR00001)
**Website**: https://weatherfile.com/location?loc_id=GBR00001&wt=KTS
**Status**: ⚠️ **API Access Restricted** - Requires authentication/validation

### Investigation Results

#### Website Structure
- **Primary URL**: `https://weatherfile.com/location?loc_id=GBR00001&wt=KTS`
- **Data Loading**: JavaScript-based dynamic loading via `renderCanvas()` function
- **API Base**: `https://weatherfile.com/api/` (confirmed to exist)
- **Authentication**: Required (API returns `{"status":"error","message":" not valid"}`)

#### Technical Analysis
- Site uses jQuery and custom JavaScript for data loading
- Weather data loaded asynchronously after page load
- API endpoints discovered but require authentication tokens/keys
- No obvious public JSON endpoints without authentication

#### Attempted API Patterns
```
❌ https://weatherfile.com/api/location?loc_id=GBR00001
❌ https://weatherfile.com/api/data/GBR00001  
❌ https://weatherfile.com/api/current/GBR00001
```
All return: `{"status":"error","message":" not valid"}`

### Alternative Approaches

#### Option 1: HTML Scraping (Like Brambles)
Since the website displays data, we could scrape the HTML content after JavaScript renders it. However, this would require:
- More complex parsing than Brambles (JavaScript execution required)
- Higher resource usage on ESP32C3
- Potential rate limiting concerns

#### Option 2: Alternative Data Sources
Look for alternative Lymington weather data sources:
- **NOAA/Met Office**: May have public APIs for UK stations
- **OpenWeatherMap**: Might have Lymington station data
- **WeatherAPI.com**: Alternative weather service
- **Local Marine Weather**: Port authorities or yacht clubs

#### Option 3: Reverse Engineering (Advanced)
Could potentially:
- Analyze JavaScript to find authentication method
- Extract session tokens or API keys
- Risk: Terms of service violations, rate limiting

### Recommended Approach

**Priority 1**: Search for alternative public APIs that provide Lymington weather data
**Priority 2**: If needed, implement HTML scraping with JavaScript evaluation
**Priority 3**: Contact WeatherFile.com for API access/documentation

### Alternative Lymington Sources to Investigate

1. **UK Met Office DataPoint API**: 
   - Public API with free tier
   - May have nearby stations

2. **OpenWeatherMap Current Weather API**:
   - `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Lymington,UK&appid=API_KEY`
   - Free tier available

3. **WeatherAPI.com**:
   - `http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=API_KEY&q=Lymington,UK`

4. **NOAA/NWS** (if available for UK):
   - May have marine weather data

### Implementation Notes

If we proceed with an alternative source:
- JSON parsing already implemented (from Seaview)
- HTTP client ready (from both stations)
- Weather data structure supports additional stations
- Easy to add as third weather command

### Next Steps

1. **Research alternative APIs** for Lymington weather data
2. **Test alternative sources** for data quality and availability  
3. **Implement chosen alternative** using existing JSON parsing infrastructure
4. **Consider contacting WeatherFile.com** for legitimate API access
